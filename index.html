      <h1>Introduction: Leadership staff, Code Specialist. 
        I graduated a radio broadcasting program in 2005, 
        back then I met a few people who are now social media 
        famous. I've held a few licenses; pest elemination specialist, 
        bail bonds, security guard, and I owned my own limousine 
        business. In 2015 just when JavaScript really began gaining
        poplularity and fame, I began checking it out to see if I like it
        because in San Francisco I had so many customers raving about it.</h1>
